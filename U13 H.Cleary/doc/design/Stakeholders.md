    What Is a Stakeholder?

A stakeholder is a party that has an interest in a business or enterprise and can either affect or be affected by the business.<br>

Typical stakeholders are investors, employees, customers, suppliers, communities, governments, or trade associations.<br>

An entity's stakeholder(s) can be both internal or external to the organization.<br>

    The different types of stakeholders

Info is pretty conflicting on exactly how many types of stakeholders there are but here i've melted them all down to their base 4 categories to make things easier.

+ Users
+ Providers
+ Influencers
+ Governance<br>

These four categories of stakeholder-y-ness villainy make the acronym UPIG. Do what you will with this information idk.<br>

I mean really look at this shit. Idk man.
