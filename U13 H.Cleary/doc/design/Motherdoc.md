# Colours

A good website needs a good colour palette.

To come up with a good colour scheme for this website I took a look at what other websites used most often and also had a look at some colour palettes others had made online.

## What others used

These examples are colours used by various websites including:

+ ee
+ Samsung
+ Buy mobiles
+ Ebay
+ Amazon

## My own ideas

When looking at a palette I liked I took inspiration from a few different things including self preference.

 In the end I settled on the following two palettes:<br>

 One consisting of mixed blues and greens as they make a nice chill ocean-y kind of mix that I've seen a few times on websites like Samsung and Buy mobiles which sell products that the website I am aiming to create will be selling.<br>

 The other mix consists of a lot of golds and browns alike to amazon and sand. I dunno man I just picked em cause I liked em.<br>

 In the end I decided i'm going to go with the first palette as I liked it more than the other.
